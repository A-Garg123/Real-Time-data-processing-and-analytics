# Achieved Result- 
Creating a solution architect for real time data processing and analytics using AWS cloud services. By using Apache Kafka Cluster we are successfully able to process the real time data streams and using AWS Athena we can easily do analytics over the processed data. This approach uniquely specifies the process of data in real time and by running some SQL queries we are able to do some analytics upon the data.
